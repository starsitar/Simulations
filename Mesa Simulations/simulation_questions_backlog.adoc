Currently being explored by the Sim:
Impact of malicious nodes:
- Are malicious nodes malicious from the start?
- What is the duration of maliciousness?
- How many blocks should we set the DKG process?
- Should we model the 14 steps in the DKG process?

Which factors might influence group size?
- node failures
- Malicious nodes

Questions for Blockscience:
- Keep Token Valuation models

General Questions:

Impact of malicious nodes:
- Are malicious nodes malicious from the start?
- What is the duration of maliciousness?
- How many blocks should we set the DKG process?
- Should we model the 14 steps in the DKG process?

Should we create a model of malicious behavior; i.e. should we create a byzantine fault scenario?

Which factors might influence group size?
- node failures
- node throughput?
- stake amount?
- token price?
- Malicious Nodes

What are the determinants of minimum stake?
- opportunity cost, marginal cost, supply/demand?
- lock up period?
- resistance to powerful adversaries?
    measured as:
        - byzantine fault tollerance?
        - DoS attack?
        - cost to collude? (under BFT?)

what is the relationship between Group lifetime and Group expense?
- Which parts of the group lifecycle involve expenditure?


Is there another protocol that we can reference?
