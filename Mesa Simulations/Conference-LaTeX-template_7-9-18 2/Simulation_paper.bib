abstract = {Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have demonstrated how to securely implement traditionally centralized systems, such as currencies, in a decentralized fashion. However, there have been few measurement studies on the level of decentralization they achieve in practice. We present a measurement study on various decentralization metrics of two of the leading cryptocurrencies with the largest market capitalization and user base, Bitcoin and Ethereum. We investigate the extent of decentralization by measuring the network resources of nodes and the interconnection among them, the protocol requirements affecting the operation of nodes, and the robustness of the two systems against attacks. In particular, we adapted existing internet measurement techniques and used the Falcon Relay Network as a novel measurement tool to obtain our data. We discovered that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum has strictly better properties than the other. We also provide concrete suggestions for improving both systems.},

abstract = {Agent-based models have been employed to describe numerous processes in immunology. Simulations based on these types of models have been used to enhance our understanding of immunology and disease pathology. We review various agent-based models relevant to host-pathogen systems and discuss their contributions to our understanding of biological processes. We then point out some limitations and challenges of agent-based models and encourage efforts towards reproducibility and model validation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Feng2012,
abstract = {It is well-known that financial asset returns exhibit fat-tailed distributions and long-term memory. These empirical features are the main objectives of modeling efforts using (i) stochastic processes to quantitatively reproduce these features and (ii) agent-based simulations to understand the underlying microscopic interactions. After reviewing selected empirical and theoretical evidence documenting the behavior of traders, we construct an agent-based model to quantitatively demonstrate that "fat" tails in return distributions arise when traders share similar technical trading strategies and decisions. Extending our behavioral model to a stochastic model, we derive and explain a set of quantitative scaling relations of long-term memory from the empirical behavior of individual market participants. Our analysis provides a behavioral interpretation of the long-term memory of absolute and squared price returns: They are directly linked to the way investors evaluate their investments by applying technical strategies at different investment horizons, and this quantitative relationship is in agreement with empirical findings. Our approach provides a possible behavioral explanation for stochastic models for financial systems in general and provides a method to parameterize such models from market data rather than from statistical fitting.},

@article{Aiyer2005,
abstract = {This paper describes a general approach to constructing cooperative services that span multiple administrative domains. In such envi- ronments, protocols must tolerate both Byzantine behaviors when broken, misconfigured, or malicious nodes arbitrarily deviate from their specification and rational behaviors when selfish nodes de- viate from their specification to increase their local benefit. The papermakes three contributions: (1) It introduces the BAR (Byzan- tine,Altruistic, Rational)model as a foundation for reasoning about cooperative services; (2) It proposes a general three-level architec- ture to reduce the complexity of building services under the BAR model; and (3) It describes an implementation of BAR-B, the first cooperative backup service to tolerate both Byzantine users and an unbounded number of rational users. At the core of BAR-B is an asynchronous replicated state machine that provides the custom- ary safety and liveness guarantees despite nodes exhibiting both Byzantine and rational behaviors. Our prototype provides accept- able performance for our application: our BAR-tolerant state ma- chine executes 15 requests per second, and our BAR-B backup ser- vice can back up 100MB of data in under 4 minutes.},

abstract = {The area of learning in multi-agent systems is today one of the most fertile grounds for interaction between game theory and artificial intelligence. We focus on the foundational questions in this interdisciplinary area, and identify several distinct agendas that ought to, we argue, be separated. The goal of this article is to start a discussion in the research community that will result in firmer foundations for the area.1 1This article has a long history and owes many debts. A first version was presented at the NIPS workshop, Multi-Agent Learning: Theory and Practice, in 2002. A later version was presented at the AAAI Fall Symposium in 2004 [Y. Shoham, R. Powers, T. Grenager, On the agenda(s) of research on multi-agent learning, in: AAAI 2004 Symposium on Artificial Multi-Agent Learning (FS-04-02), AAAI Press, 2004]. Over time it has gradually evolved into the current form, as a result of our own work in the area as well as the feedback of many colleagues. We thank them all collectively, with special thanks to members of the multi-agent group at Stanford in the past three years. Rakesh Vohra and Michael Wellman provided detailed comments on the latest draft which resulted in substantive improvements, although we alone are responsible for the views put forward.

@article{Seo2017,
abstract = {Fault-tolerant distributed algorithms play an important role in many critical/high-availability applications. These algorithms are notori-ously difficult to implement correctly, due to asynchronous com-munication and the occurrence of faults, such as the network drop-ping messages or computers crashing. We introduce PSYNC, a domain specific language based on the Heard-Of model, which views asynchronous faulty systems as syn-chronous ones with an adversarial environment that simulates asyn-chrony and faults by dropping messages. We define a runtime sys-tem for PSYNC that efficiently executes on asynchronous networks. We formalize the relation between the runtime system and PSYNC in terms of observational refinement. The high-level lockstep ab-straction introduced by PSYNC simplifies the design and imple-mentation of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms and enables auto-mated formal verification. We have implemented an embedding of PSYNC in the SCALA programming language with a runtime system for asynchronous networks. We show the applicability of PSYNC by implementing several important fault-tolerant distributed algorithms and we com-pare the implementation of consensus algorithms in PSYNC against implementations in other languages in terms of code size, runtime efficiency, and verification.},

While there exist previous threshold schemes for the ECDSA signature scheme, we are the first protocol that supports multiparty signatures for any {\$}t {\l}eq n{\$} with an efficient dealerless key generation. Our protocol is faster than previous solutions and significantly reduces the communication complexity as well. We prove our scheme secure against malicious adversaries with a dishonest majority.

@article{Smith2007,
abstract = {Most social and psychological phenomena occur not as the result of isolated decisions by individuals but rather as the result of repeated interactions between multiple individuals over time. Yet the theory-building and modeling techniques most commonly used in social psychology are less than ideal for understanding such dynamic and interactive processes. This article describes an alternative approach to theory building, agent-based modeling (ABM), which involves simulation of large numbers of autonomous agents that interact with each other and with a simulated environment and the observation of emergent patterns from their interactions. The authors believe that the ABM approach is better able than prevailing approaches in the field, variable-based modeling (VBM) techniques such as causal modeling, to capture types of complex, dynamic, interactive processes so important in the social world. The article elaborates several important contrasts between ABM and VBM and offers specific recommendations for learning more and applying the ABM approach.},
