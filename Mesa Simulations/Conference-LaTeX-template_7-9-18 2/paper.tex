\begin{abstract}
    ABM is an effective tool for analysis of complex systems with long term 
    emergent behavior. In this study we apply ABM to analyse the long term 
    behavior of Keepâ€™s random beacon. We look for the emergence of steady 
    state behavior, at which point we evaluate the sensitivity of specific 
    group and signature characteristics to various parameters. The results 
    of this study illustrates the effectiveness of ABM as an aid to the design 
    of novel distributed systems.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Agent Based Modeling (ABM)}
ABM has traditionally been a tool to simulate complex dynamic systems 
such as the spread of pathogens \cite{Bauer2009}, social psychology 
\cite{Smith2007}, and financial markets \cite{Feng2012}. It is well suited
to systems that resist simple analytical solutions due to the interaction of 
complex individual agents with varying attributes. As a bottom up approach, ABM
has been gaining in popularity over tradtional methods such as Discrete Event
Simulation, and can provide more convincing theoretical analysis than approaches
such as general equilibrium analysis \cite{Wang2018}.
